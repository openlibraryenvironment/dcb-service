/**
 * This package handles the parsing and construction of Alam objects.
 * 
 * CONVENTIONS are really important here as the Alma docs, whilst apparently thorough and detailed
 * can be confusing. At the top level - create a sub-package for each alma xsd. For example
 * https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/alma/apis/docs/xsd/rest_holdings.xsd/ maps to the holdings package.
 * 
 * When creating a new subpackage, please add the alam doc url at the same level.
