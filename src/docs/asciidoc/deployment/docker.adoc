The module is built and published as a docker container on the link:https://nexus.libsdev.k-int.com/#browse/browse:libsdev-docker:v2%2Fknowledgeintegration%2Freshare-dcb[K-Int repository]

The images are tagged using the major/minor version numbers, so you are free to decide at which level you wish to track the software.

$ docker pull docker.libsdev.k-int.com/knowledgeintegration/reshare-dcb:1-SNAPSHOT
